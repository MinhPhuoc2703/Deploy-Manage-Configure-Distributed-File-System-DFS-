# Distributed File System (DFS) â€“ Deployment, Management, and Configuration

## ðŸ“– Introduction

This project is the final report for the **Network System Administration** course at  
**Ton Duc Thang University â€“ Faculty of Information Technology**.

The topic focuses on the **deployment, management, and configuration of the Distributed File System (DFS)** in a Windows Server environment. The main goal is to study the theoretical background of DFS, implement it in practice, and evaluate its functionality and limitations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Understand the concepts of **DFS, DFS Namespace, and DFS Replication**.
- Deploy DFS in a Windows domain environment.
- Configure and manage DFS using both **GUI** and **PowerShell**.
- Verify replication and namespace functionalities.

## ðŸ“š Contents

1. **Theoretical Foundation**

   - Distributed File System overview
   - DFS Namespace and DFS Replication
   - Replication process and common solutions

2. **Implementation**

   - System requirements and deployment model
   - Step-by-step deployment with GUI
     - Active Directory setup
     - Adding DFS servers to the domain
     - Configuring DFS namespace and replication
     - Testing DFS functionality
   - Implementation with PowerShell

3. **Conclusion**
   - Achieved results
   - Lessons learned
   - Limitations and improvement directions

## ðŸ›  Tools and Environment

- Windows Server (Active Directory + DFS role)
- Domain Controller
- DFS-01 and DFS-02 servers
- PowerShell for automation

## ðŸ“Œ Results

- Successful deployment of DFS namespace and replication between servers.
- Verified file replication and availability across DFS servers.
- Practical understanding of DFS in enterprise environments.
